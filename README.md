# Maze-War
This is a maze game using simple graphics to reinforce some concepts, mainly use of plists, game data file, parallax background, while studying a cartoonSmart online course.

The gamedata.plist allows you to change graphics easily, set the character and enemy speeds per level and toggle the visability of the collision bodies used.
The project also shows the use of a gamedata file for global variables and functions.

Tiled (http://www.mapeditor.org) is used for basic level layout and the resulting xml file parsed to produce the game level.
